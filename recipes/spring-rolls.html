    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>These fresh Vietnamese spring rolls are a refreshing change from the usual fried variety and have become a family favorite. They are a lovely, light appetizer and delicious dipped in one or both of the sauces included in this recipe. Great for parties as you can prep them ahead of time.</p>
    <p>Spring rolls are appetizers that consist of a savory filling in a paper-thin wrapper made from flour and water. The exterior is so thin and crispy, it will shatter to the touch. Spring roll wrappers are thinner and more delicate than egg roll wrappers.</p>
